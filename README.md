# FileReadingBenchmark

Compares the speed of reading from an `InputStream` to reading from a memory-mapped `FileChannel`, for a range of file sizes, and a range of the number of concurrent threads.

Please run this benchmark 3x, without anything else currently running on your machine, and copy/paste your results (along with the details on your OS, number of cores, RAM, Java version, and HDD/SSD type) into a PasteBin doc, then post the PasteBin link to the [ClassGraph gitter page](https://gitter.im/classgraph/Lobby). Thanks!
